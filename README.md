# Data

The data has been set up as request in the specification in the [data](/PatientManagement/data) folder. Most of the application should work even if these files are damaged.

The program will show the credentials for first accounts of each type on the login form for your convenience. The other accounts can be interacted with using the system as intended, or you can find their credentials in their appropriate data file.
